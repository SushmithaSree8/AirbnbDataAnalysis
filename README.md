## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project requires installation of nltk and wordcloud which will be used for the analysis of reviews. The code should run fine with Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of the project is to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the AirBNB listings in San Francisco. Particulary this project aims to answer the following questions:

3. How has the importance of cleanliness score changed during the pandemic?
